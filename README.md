# Sunscreen
Sunscreen is a (very) WIP GUI library, built with ultimate platform compatability in mind. It removes the limitations of chest GUIs, meaning you can place any element anywhere! Input is also ahead of chest GUIs, with inputs ranging from clicking and hovering to text input, anywhere on the screen!

![Showcase of the library](./assets/image/showcase-gif.gif)

> [!WARNING]  
> This library/plugin won't run without the default assets, which are kept out from source on purpose. ~~Contact ``@combimagnetron`` on Discord for a possible test run with assets.~~ Currently not handing out assets.

## Features
- Native support for text input
- Hover and click animations
- Client sided cursor
- FOV-Locking
- Full screen menu capability
- Replace menus from any plugin!
- Ingame editor (WIP)
